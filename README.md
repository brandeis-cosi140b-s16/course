## Group Contract and Annotation Goals

### Group Contract
The group contract is a document that you and your teammates will use to assign responsibility for specific tasks within the larger project. These can be divided however you want, as long as everyone in the group feels that the tasks are shared equally. There are a few options for how to divide the work â€” some ways you might want to consider are:

* Divide by task: each group member gets a number of the tasks outlined in [the assignment section](http://www.cs140.org/assignments/) on website.
* Divide by skill: the group discusses what skills they bring to the group, and the work within the tasks is divided up accordingly.
* Everyone takes part: if you prefer that everyone have a say in all the aspects of the grade, the we recommend outlining roles within the group. For example, one person might be in charge of starting each task, one person will be the timekeeper, and the other will be the editor.

Please note that everyone in the group will be doing annotation, so that should not factor into the task assignment. 

### Annotation Goals
There are many different topics in linguistics that you and your team can choose to examine over the course of the semester. 

When writing up the annotation goal, your team should be able to express what you hope to achieve with the annotation, and how far-reaching the task will be. For example, if you want to do genre annotation of newspaper articles, how specific will your categories be? Will you do broad categories, such as `world news`, `local news`, `sports`, or will you be more specific: `sports: baseball`, `world news: Europe`?

### Submission and Grading
We provide here a form for the group contract. You can use you own form if you want, however the contract should include;

* Names of group members
* Annotation goals
* Skills you expect to contribute to the project
* Division of subtasks among members

TA will set up git repositories for groups after 2/2 class. You must upload the contract (at least `annotation goals` section written) on your repository by the end of that day. You can continue to discuss the division of tasks. Once you are all satisfied with the contract, everyone in the group must sign it and it must be turned in to TA by the end of 2/5 class. The contract itself is not a subject to grade, but it will be useful later in the peer evaluation section. Changes to the contract can be made throughout the semester, but must be submitted (signed) to TA.
